Yes, my daughter\u2019s limbs are quite different \u2014&nbsp;thus the common term used to describe her disability as having \u201climb differences.\u201d Her left arm stops above the elbow \u2014 a short round nub. Her right arm is a little longer, but still short with no elbow and a small, atypical hand. Her legs are also both shorter, and different lengths at that, but she does have two feet, which she uses for most fine motor skills like writing and assembling lego spaceships. Yes, the doctor was correct about her limbs, but other than that, he didn\u2019t tell us a damn thing!<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultrasound machines are not \u201cfuture predicting machines.\u201d If that ultrasound had been really accurate our appointment might have gone something like this:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Add any video or audio, even twitter embed<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1140\" height=\"641\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/T79f-R8P5SI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Doctor, chuckles: \u201cCompared to everything else she\u2019s got going on, small potatoes, guys.
